      "content": "**Docker Compose Flow:**\n1. Your NGC API key is set as an environment variable\n2. Docker Compose reads the configuration\n3. Images are pulled from nvcr.io using your key\n4. All NeMo services start in containers\n\n**Helm Chart Flow:**\n1. Your NGC API key authenticates with NGC Helm registry\n2. The Helm chart is fetched (if auto-fetch is enabled)\n3. Chart is extracted and customized with your API key\n4. Kubernetes resources are created in the 'nemo' namespace\n5. Images are pulled using imagePullSecrets configured with your key\n6. Pods start running NeMo microservices"

      "title": "Deployment Options",
      "icon": "⚙️",
      "content": "**Helm with Auto-Fetch** - Automatically downloads the specified version of the NeMo Helm chart from NGC, then deploys it. This is the recommended option for getting started.\n\n**Helm (Local Chart)** - Uses a Helm chart that already exists in your local directory. Choose this if you've already downloaded the chart or made custom modifications.\n\n**Docker Compose** - Deploys NeMo using Docker Compose. Simpler than Helm but less flexible. Best for single-node deployments and development."

      "icon": "🔧",
      "content": "**Common Issues:**\n\n• **Authentication Failed** - Verify your NGC API key is valid and has access to nemo-microservices\n• **Chart Not Found** - Ensure you have network access to helm.ngc.nvidia.com\n• **Pod Pending** - Check if your cluster has sufficient resources\n• **ImagePullBackOff** - Your NGC key may not have access to required images\n• **Connection Refused** - For local K8s, use native mode or host network mode\n\nFor detailed troubleshooting, check the deployment logs and consult the NeMo Microservices documentation."
