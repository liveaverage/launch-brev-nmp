      "content": "Your NGC API key must have the following scopes/permissions:\n\n**Required Scopes:**\n• **NGC Catalog** - Access to pull container images from nvcr.io\n• **Private Registry** - Pull Helm charts and NeMo microservice images\n• **Cloud Functions** - Ability to invoke NGC endpoints and functions\n\n**How to verify:**\n1. Go to https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-key\n2. Check that your key has access to the nemo-microservices resources\n3. Ensure your organization has NeMo Microservices entitlements\n\n**Common permission errors:**\n• `401 Unauthorized` - Key lacks required scopes\n• `403 Forbidden` - Organization not entitled to NeMo\n• `ImagePullBackOff` - Key cannot pull from nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-microservices"

      "content": "**Docker Compose Flow:**\n1. Your NGC API key is set as an environment variable\n2. Docker Compose reads the configuration\n3. Images are pulled from nvcr.io using your key\n4. All NeMo services start in containers\n\n**Helm Chart Flow:**\n1. Your NGC API key authenticates with NGC Helm registry\n2. The Helm chart is fetched (if auto-fetch is enabled)\n3. Chart is extracted and customized with your API key\n4. Kubernetes resources are created in the 'nemo' namespace\n5. Images are pulled using imagePullSecrets configured with your key\n6. Pods start running NeMo microservices"

      "title": "Deployment Options",
      "icon": "⚙️",
      "content": "**Helm with Auto-Fetch** - Automatically downloads the specified version of the NeMo Helm chart from NGC, then deploys it. This is the recommended option for getting started.\n\n**Helm (Local Chart)** - Uses a Helm chart that already exists in your local directory. Choose this if you've already downloaded the chart or made custom modifications.\n\n**Docker Compose** - Deploys NeMo using Docker Compose. Simpler than Helm but less flexible. Best for single-node deployments and development."

      "content": "**Automatic Proxy:** After deployment, a reverse proxy starts on port `8080`. Point your tunnel there.\n\n**How it works:** NeMo Studio calls `http://nemo.test:3000/v1/...` which browsers can't resolve. The proxy rewrites these to relative paths (`/v1/...`) that work with any tunnel URL.\n\n**Prerequisites:** Enable ingress in your cluster:\n• microk8s: `microk8s enable ingress`\n• k3s: ingress is enabled by default\n• Other: install nginx-ingress controller\n\n**Architecture:**\n`Browser → Tunnel → nginx (:8080) → K8s Ingress → NeMo Services`\n\n**Manual Control:**\n• Start: `bash nemo-proxy/start-proxy.sh`\n• Custom backend: `BACKEND=10.0.0.5:80 bash nemo-proxy/start-proxy.sh`\n• Stop: `docker stop nemo-proxy`"
